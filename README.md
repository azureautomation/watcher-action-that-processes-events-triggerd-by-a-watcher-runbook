Watcher action that processes events triggerd by a watcher runbook
==================================================================

            

This sample automation runbook is designed to be used in a watcher task that takes action on data passed in from a watcher runbook. It is required to have a parameter called $EVENTDATA in watcher action runbooks to receive information from the watcher runbook.


You can search for 'Watch-NewFile' in the gallery to see the watcher runbook that will trigger this action as part of an Azure Automation watcher task.


 

 

        
    
TechNet gallery is retiring! This script was migrated from TechNet script center to GitHub by Microsoft Azure Automation product group. All the Script Center fields like Rating, RatingCount and DownloadCount have been carried over to Github as-is for the migrated scripts only. Note : The Script Center fields will not be applicable for the new repositories created in Github & hence those fields will not show up for new Github repositories.
